1.5 Vulnerability Scanning Concepts
------------------------------------------------------------
* 1.5 Explain vulnerability scanning concepts
	+ Vulnerability scanners give the ability to identify a variety of systems across the network including:
		- Laptops
		- Desktops
		- Client and Servers
			* Client-side vulnerabilties
			* Server-side vulnerabilities
	+ Passively test security controls
		- Can be performed by PVSs or Passive Vulnerabilty Scanner
		- Passive scan does not locate wireless SSIDs that have be hidden
		- Active scan emit probes to the APs to locate them
	+ Identify vulnerabilities
		- Classify
			* Low Importance
			* Medium Importance
			* High Importance
		- Types
			* SMB Detection
			* DCE Enumeration Detection
			* OS Identification
			* Open Ports
			* Open Systems
	+ Identify lack of security controls
		- Types\(Lack of\)
			* Physical Controls
				+ Locks
				+ Fences
				+ Man-traps
			* Access Controls
				+ Data
				+ Programs
				+ Systems
				+ Equipment
		- Potential Outcome
			- Intercepting Data
			- Accessing a remote host to steal, modifying data
			- Impersonation of a user/employee/contractor
			- Inserting communications
			- replaying communications
	+ Identify common misconfigurations
		- Password Management
			* Weak passwords
			* Password reuse
			* Password Sharing
			* Shared Accounts
		- Unecessary Services
		- Disablng Firewall
		- *Use Windows Server 2016 with MBSA*
		- *Use scan results talking about best practices*
	+ Intrusive vs. non-intrusive
		- Intrusive
			* Remember that not all companies can afford downtime while a thorough vulernability scan is performed
			* Intrusive scans could introduce the possibility of downtime
			* destructive security auditing or intrusive scanning can yield more accurate results as the intent is to use the exact same methods an attack would use
			* Intrus
		- Non-intrusive
			* This technique usually employs simple scans such aa file systems, missing updates
	+ Credentialed vs. non-credentialed
		- Credentialed scans can give acccess to more information
		- Non-credentialed scans give limited information
	+ False positive
		- False negative = Incorrectly identified
			* Malicious traffic identified as legitimate
		- False positive = Incorrectly identified
			* Legitimate traffic identified as malicious
			* An IDS/IPS learning process will start with a lot of false positives intially then over time will be reduced as the process continues
		- True negative = Correctly identified
		- True positive = Correctly identified
