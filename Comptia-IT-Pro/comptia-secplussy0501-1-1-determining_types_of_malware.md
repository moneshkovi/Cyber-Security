Title: Determining Types of Malware
Subtitle: CompTIA Security+ \(SY0-501\)

1.1 Determining Types of Malware
------------------------------------------------------------

* Given a scenario, analyze indicators of compromise and determine the type of malware
    + Viruses
    	- Boot sector virus
    	- Polymorphic virus
    	- Macro virus
    	- Resident virus
    		* loads itself into RAM and infects any file or program
    		* can load itself into memory with the OS
    		* can block the actions of the antivirus
    	- File Infectors
    	- Stealth virus
    		* intercepts calls from the OS
    	- Logic Bombs
    	- Multipartite Virus
	+ Crypto-malware
		- CryptoLocker
		- CryptoDefense
		- CryptoWall
	+ Ransomware\(type of scareware\)
		- https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-295A
		- Ransomware is a type of malware that infects a computer and restricts a userâ€™s access to the infected computer or files typically until a ransom is paided.
		- FBI Warning locks the user out of their desktop while not requiring a payment
		- FAKEAV shows fake antimalware scanning results to coax the user into purchasing the bogus software.
	+ Worm
		- Polymorphic-worm have the ability to change their form
		- They can encrypt themselves to avoid detection
	+ Trojan
		- One difference between trojans and other malware types is that trojans do not try to replicate/propagate themselves]
		- What types of attacks the trojan paves the way for depends on the motivation of the attacker.
		- Botnets, viruses, ransomware, identity theft, data theft, money theft, spying
	+ Rootkit
		- Zues = 2007
		- Stuxnet = IDS/SCADA
		- Flame
		- Can monitor & record
			* Audio & Video
			* Capture Screenshots
			* Keyboard activity\(keylogger\)
			* Network activity
		- Remote control
		- User-mode = simpler, easiest to remove
		- Kernal-mode = OS privilege
		- Firmware-based = Loads itself into memory at the same time or before the OS and drivers
		- Symptoms
			* Bluescreens
			* Keyboard lockups
			* Permission changes
			* Network communication problems\(intermittent\)
			* Heavy workload
	+ Keylogger
		- Survellience Sofware/Hardware
		- Malicious/Non-Malicious
		- Security Auditing
		- Demo capabilities
	+ Adware
