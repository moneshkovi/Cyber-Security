6.1 Basic Concepts of Cryptography
-----------------------------------------------------------
* 6.1 Compare and contrast basic concepts of cryptography
	+ Symmetric algorithms
		- Basic Diagram
	+ Modes of operation
		- Basic Diagram
	+ Asymmetric algorithms
	+ Hashing
	+ Salt, IV, nonce
		- Salts
			* Adds additional bits to a password prior to a hashing operation being performed on it
		- IVs
			* added to plaintext to ensure that identical plaintexts inputs do not produce the same ciphertext outputs
			* http://aesencryption.net/
			* Plaintext - This is my secret text
			* Key - QF0yS%7#LQD6'7hq]{Z94k/3Y'kAw4
			* Cipher Text - uIIXiWX2uowfJwaJV+IBU7bVO5oG6n7ez2VdrpkXrCA=
	+ Elliptic curve
		- Smaller key sizes
		- Stronger Keys in smaller sizes
		- ECC 256 is as strong as thousands of times stronger than a RSA key
	+ Weak/deprecated algorithms
	+ Key exchange
		- Mention Diffie-Hellman
		- Will be demonstrated in PFS below
	+ Digital signatures
		- See Diagram
	+ Diffusion
		- A principle in en encryption where a modification of a single bit of plaintext should modify a large number of bits in the ciphertext\(goal is about 50%\).
	+ Confusion
		- Seeks to make the relationship between the key and the ciphertext as complex and involved as much as possible.
	+ Collision
	+ Steganography
		- Steganography lets you send messages without raising suspicion, but runs the risk of being discovered
		- Encryption lets you conceal the message but not the fact that the message exists
	+ Obfuscation
		- Code obfuscation makes it harder to reverse engineer, if a company is worried about that
		- If you obfuscate the licensing process of the software it makes is more difficult to reverse engineer that process
	+ Stream vs. block
		- Review
	+ Key strength
	+ Session keys
		- SSL/TLS
		- Mentioned in PFS below
	+ Ephemeral key
		- A cryptographic key that is generated for each execution of a key establishment process
		- A unique key every time a key is established
		- Ephemeral is lasting a short time, short lifecycle, short lived
	+ Secret algorithm
	+ Data-in-transit
		- Data that is traversing a network
		- Data that is in a buffer waiting to be transmitted/processed
		- Data that is in system memory waiting to be processed
		- Data is protected with ACLs, encryption and hashing
	+ Data-at-rest
		- Data stored on a device or storage media
		- Data that is not being used by applications
		- Data that is not being transfer over network medium
		- Examples
			* Backups
			* Offsite Backups
			* External media
		- Data is proteced with encryption, hashing and ACLs
	+ Data-in-use
		- Data that is actively being processed by applications
		- Data that is being viewed and/or modified by a user
		- Data is protected with ACLs
	+ Random/pseudo-random number generation
		- TRNG
			* TRNG produces a random string based on a physical process like static in airwaves, ocean waves, thermal noise
		- PRNG
			* PRNG produce a random string of numbers via a mathematical algorithm
			* Not truly random, however when the number string is compared to a truly random string it APPEARs random
		- Hardware-based
			* a device that generated random number strings
			* ChaosKey http://altusmetrum.org/ChaosKey/
			* Araneus Alea II http://bit.ly/2qemY89
			* PureQuantumâ„¢ http://bit.ly/2p3PknC
		- Software-based
			* https://www.random.org/
	+ Key stretching
	+ Implementation vs. algorithm selection
		- Crypto service provider
			* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\Defaults\Provider
			* Software Library with individual modules
			* They implement Microsoft's CryptoAPI
			* The CSPs implement the algorithms and standards
			* CSPs abstract the cryptographic components so application do not have to
			* CSP > CryptoAPI > Application
			* Implementation is in the form of a dll
		- Crypto modules
			* A hardware device or software that performs cryptographic operations within a physical or logical boundary
			* Defined in FIPS 140-2 \(Federal Information Processing Standards\): Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules
	+ Perfect forward secrecy
		- See slide
	+ Security through obscurity
	+ Common use cases
		- Low power devices\(symmetric)
		- Low latency\(symmetric, smaller keys)
		- High resiliency
		- Supporting confidentiality\(asymmetric, symmetric)
		- Supporting integrity\(digital certificates, hashing)
		- Supporting obfuscation \(XOR process, ROT13, substitution ciphers\)
		- Supporting authentication \(asymmetric encryption, perfect forward secrecy, key stretching\)
		- Supporting non-repudiation\(digital signatures, asymmetric, Perfect Forward Secrecy)
		- Resource vs. security constraints
			* Security constraints define the level of privileges to a collection of resources
			* Security constraints grant or deny access to a resource
