3.9 Importance of Physical Security
------------------------------------------------------------
* 3.9 Explain the importance of physical security controls.
	+ Lighting
		- Illumination of important areas such as entry-control points
		- Perimeters of buildings and fences
		- Not a psychological deterent
		- Relatively inexpensive to maintain
		- Assist guards and camera-based systems
		- Should have power backup, or UPS support
	+ Signs
		- Authorized entry points\(public access point to secured access\)
		- Controlled entry points\(public access point to customer area\)
		- Warning signs around perimeters
		- Physical hazard areas
	+ Fencing/gate/cage
		- Fencing is the most common phyiscal security component
		- Example
			* United States Geological Physical Security Handbook 440-2H
			* http://bit.ly/2oDQtCc
	+ Security guards
		- Real-time monitoring
		- Reacting in realtime to intrusion events
		- Human element is more adaptable to events that IDS systems
		- SANS Reading Room Whitepaper 37120

	+ Alarms
	+ Safes
	+ Secure cabinets/enclosures
	+ Protected distribution/Protected cabling
		- PDS or Protected Distribution Systems
		- Protection of wireline and optical fiber PDS to tranmit unencrypted information
		- National Security Telecommunication and Information Security Instruction \(NSTISSI\) No. 7003 standardized PDSs to tranmit unencrypted National Security Information
		- Stress the need for continued phyiscal security integrity
	+ Airgap
	+ Mantrap
	+ Faraday cage
		- Time for the tin foil hat
		- Side-channel attack is a form of reverse enginneering in which circuitry leaks EM fields making it possible for capture. The attacker is able to deduce the information or data that is being processed.

		 	* Types
				+ IC
				+ SoC
				+ IoTs,are susceptible

	+ Lock types
		- Traditional
			+ Deadbolts
			+ Padlock
			+ Knoblock
			+ Leverlock/Latchllock
		-  Keyless-entry/Electronic
			+ Pin-code lock

			+ RFID, proximity
			+ Keyfob, card-access
				* http://bit.ly/2p8aH8S
			+ Biometrics
				* http://bit.ly/2pqZbCn
		- Multfactor Authenticatio/MMA
	+ Biometrics
		- Types
			* Fingerprint readers
			* Hand geometry scanners
			* Retinal scanners
			* Face recognition
			* Voice recognition
	+ Barricades/bollards
		- Guides traffic away from an area
		- Prevents from vehicle intrusions
		- Can be static or hydraulic \(think Gunter's AFB\)
		- Can be crash rated to within vehicular impacts
		- Types
			* Jersey Barriers
			* http://bit.ly/2pqNOdJ
	+ Tokens/cards
		- Mentioned throughout, keyfobs,smartcards, RFID
	+ Environmental controls
		- HVAC
		- Hot and cold aisles
		- Fire suppression
			* National Fire Protection Agency or NFPA-75
			* Standard for the Fire Protection of Information Technology Equipment

	+ Cable locks
		- Kabilt
		- Keningston
		- Keningston Security Slots
		- Targus
	+ Screen filters
		- Prying eyes
		- Privacy Filters
		- Privacy Screens
		- http://amzn.to/2okAg1n
	+ Cameras
	+ Motion detection
		* Radar-waves relying on reflection back to a sensor
		* Photo-sensitive detects using lasers and light sensor
		* Passive Infrared or PiR using abrupt changes in the infrared energy.
	+ Logs
		* Vistor access
			+ Being able to uniquely identify and record individual's access 24/7
		* Event monitoring
		* Log retention for auditing or review purposes
		* Securely storing logs
	+ Infrared detection
		- Most IR bem sensors come with one to three beams
		- More beams, larger coverage area or creating taller beam that is harder to bypass
	+ Key management
		- Key falling into the hands of an unauthorized
		- Gives unathorized person or persons
		- Data breachs
		- Corrupted keys can render data unreadable
